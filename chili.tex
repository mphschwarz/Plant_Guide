\subsection{germination}

\begin{enumerate}
\item 	Remove the seeds from the peppers and dry the seeds.
\item 	Plant the seeds in a moist substrate you don't have to water frequently e.g. in a small greenhouse or a pot covered in ceran wrap.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{pruning}
\begin{itemize}
\item 	You can remove the leaves from the bottom part of the stem.
	This will encourage more growth and make it look more like a little tree
\item	Prune long shoots as the plant may not be able to hold them up by themselvs.
	This will also keep the plant a more manageable size.
\end{itemize}
