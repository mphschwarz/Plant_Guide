\section{Orchids}

\subsection{Watering}
\begin{itemize}
\item 	Water orchids $\sim$ every other week.
\item 	Use fertilizer once a month, using the dunking method, else just hold the pot under the tap.
\item 	If the roots are green and fleshy the orchid still has enough water, skip watering it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Repotting}
When:
\begin{itemize}
\item	There is visible rot on roots.
\item	The leaves are wilting and seems to not get enough water.
\item	The plant has grown so much that most of the roots are no longer in contact with the substrate.
\end{itemize}
How:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 	Remove plant from pot.
\item 	Remove all substrate from the roots and dispose of it, it may contain mold.
\item 	Prune any root that shows signs of rot e.g. it is spongy or discoloured.
\item 	Repot using substrate and spaghnum moss. 
	Be sure to set the plant as low as possible to let new roots have contact with substrate
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Propagation}
\begin{itemize}
\item	Tie spaghnum moss to spot where the branch may branch off. \\

\end{itemize}
