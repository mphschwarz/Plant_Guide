\subsection{Propagation}

\begin{enumerate}
\item	Cut away a band of bark at the bottom of the branch you want to propagate.
\item	Cut a hole in the bottom of a PET bottle large enough to fit the branch.
\item	Slit the bottle from the top to the hole you just cut. 
\item	Fill the PET bottle halfway with potting soil.
\item	Clamp it around the branch with the band of removed bark at the bottom.
\item 	Fill the bottle up with potting soil the rest of the way.
\item	Water the soil in the bottle and keep it we until you can see the roots filling the bottle.
\item 	Cut off the branch below the new roots, remove the bottle and plant it.
\end{enumerate}
